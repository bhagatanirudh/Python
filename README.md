# Web-Scraper-Internshala
This is a Python program that automates the Internshala website to find internships based on the user's preferences. The program uses the Selenium library to navigate the website, enter search criteria, and scrape the resulting internship listings. Once an internship matching the user's preferences is found, the program takes a screenshot and sends it along with the internship link to the user's WhatsApp using the PyWhatKit library.

This program saves time and effort for anyone looking for internships on the Internshala website. It eliminates the need for manual searching and allows users to quickly find relevant internships based on their preferences. The screenshot and link sent to WhatsApp also make it easy for users to view and apply to the internship directly from their mobile devices.
